# GymMate

## Description

Duration 2 week sprint.

The problem solved by this project was to create an application where the user is able to track exercises within a calendar, while providing suggestions based on a user's selected muscle grouping. The application will store user data using postgreSQL and allow the user to add notes and exercises to the calendar.

### Prerequisites

Node.js
React
Redux-SAGAs
Material UI

### Installation

Create a database named your prime_app with a datatable called GymMate.

The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.

Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install

Run npm run server in your terminal

Run npm run client in your terminal

The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

The survey application should be running and fully functional!

### Usage 

To use this application simply click on a day on the calendar and then press the button to either add in a note or the button to add exercises. When adding exercises input the number of repetitions according to your fitness goals and press the submit button.
